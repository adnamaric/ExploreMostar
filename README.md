# ExploreMostar

Explore Mostar was my final-year thesis project, based on C# programming language and ASP.NET Core framework. The abovementioned project consists of two parts: a mobile application built on Xamarin platform and a Windows forms application. The mobile application takes the user's current location through external Google API and recommends the best content in the user's immediate vicinity ( ex: best restaurants, coffee shops).
